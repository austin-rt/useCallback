# `useCallback` – Demystifying React Hooks (Pt. 1)

In this article, we will explore when and how to use React’s `useCallback` hook
and a mistake made by most Junior Developers.

If you'd like, you can skim this as a

article.

## Getting Started

- `fork and clone`
- `cd client`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

## Referential Equality

Referential Equality is a foundational concept in both JavaScript and Computer
Science as a whole. So let's start with a demonstration of it in action.

You can simply read along or run `referentialEquality.js` to observe the output.

```js
console.log(1 === 1);
// prints true
```

When evaluating whether the `integer 1` is strictly equal to the `integer 1`,
the console prints `true`. This is because, well... the `integer 1` **is**
strictly equal to the `integer 1`.

We see the same result when evaluating two strings.

```js
console.log('Referential Equality' === 'Referential Equality');
// prints true
```

Obviously, this will always be the case for two
[primitive data types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive)
of the same value.

Now, what about data structures? For example, two object literals with the same
key/value pairs? What about empty object literals?

```js
console.log({ a: 1 } === { a: 1 });
// prints false
```

Why would this print `false`? When comparing whether these two object literals
are strictly equal, JavaScript uses their respective **_memory addresses_**.

In other words, these two objects may contain the same **values**, but they're
not **referencing the same object**. They _look_ the same but occupy two
different _spaces in memory_.

The same applies whether you're comparing two object literals, two array
literals, or two functions!

```js
console.log({} === {});
// prints false

console.log([1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3]);
// prints false

console.log([] === []);
// prints false
```

To demonstrate this further, we will define a function `func`, which returns an
anonymous function that, in turn, returns something else (_like a JSX element_).

```js
const func = () => {
  return () => 'This is a pretend component.';
};
```

We will then assign two different functions, `firstRender` and `secondRender`,
equal to the value returned by `func`.

```js
const firstRender = func();

const secondRender = func();
```

> Think of <code>func</code> as your React functional component, while
> `firstRender` is a function _inside_ of it on the first render, and
> <code>secondRender</code> is a function _inside_ of it on the second render.

Even though `firstRender` and `secondRender` look the same, return the same
value, and are even assigned their value from the same definition, they do not
have _referrential equality_. As a result, every time the parent component
renders, it redefines this function.

```js
console.log(firstRender === secondRender);
// false
```

Unfortunately, in JavaScript, it isn’t easy to print these memory addresses like
in Python, but for a slightly more in-depth explanation of reference vs. value,
take a look
at[this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-grip-on-reference-vs-value-in-javascript-cba3f86da223/).

This topic can get dense, and you don't need to teach a class on it tonight. So
for now, just remember:

- primitive data type `===` primitive data type
- data structure `!==` data structure.

With referential equality out of the way, let's dive into our React code and see
why this is relevant.

# Starter Code

Start by looking through the provided code, then open your dev tools. We're
going to be using the browser's console in a bit.

After we spin up our app, open the `BookDetails.jsx` component and re-save. The
first thing we may notice in our React dev server is a common `WARNING` that
young developers tend to ignore. As you hit the workforce and start writing code
for production, your linters will be even more strict than what’s built into
`create-react-app`. `WARNINGS` will turn to `ERRORS`, and some linter rules
won't even allow you to push without addressing these `ERRORS`.

And brace yourself; most linters won't allow `console.logs` in your code. So the
earlier you learn the proper way, the better. So rather than ignore it, let’s
figure out how to treat it.

```
WARNING in [eslint]
src/components/BookDetails.jsx
  Line 18:6:  React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'getBookDetails'. Either include it or remove the dependency array  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

webpack compiled with 1 warning
```

**NOTE: you may first need to re-save BookDetails.jsx to create this `WARNING`**

If we dig into the
[React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#step-2-specify-the-effect-dependencies),
we can decode the semi-confusing proposed solutions to this `WARNING` as
follows:

---

Take a moment to think through the consequences of each option.

<details>
<summary>
1. Include the function definition inside of the <code>useEffect</code>
 </summary>
<blockquote>
We cannot call this function elsewhere unless we redefine it.
</blockquote>
 </details>

</br>

<details>
<summary>
2. Remove the dependency array.
</summary>
<blockquote>
This will trigger the <code>useEffect</code> <strong>every time</strong> the state or props change, typically causing an infinite re-render, and in our case, it could overload our API with infinite requests.
</blockquote>
</details>

</br>

<details>
<summary>
3. Remove the function call from the <code>useEffect</code>.
</summary>
<blockquote>
The function won't get called.
</blockquote>
</details>

</br>

<details>
<summary>
4. Include the function in the dependency array.
</summary>
<blockquote>
The first time the component renders, it will define our function, which will trigger the useEffect, which will cause the component to re-render, which will redefine the function, which will trigger the useEffect, which will cause the component to re-render, which will redefine the function...
</blockquote>
</details>
</br>

_So ...what's a developer to do?_

---

The simplest and preferred solution would be to 'include it,' that is, move the
`getBookDetails` function definition inside the `useEffect`. This adheres to an
Object-Oriented Programming principal known as
[Encapsulation](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-for-beginners-what-is-encapsulation/).

But let’s say we know we need to call the function elsewhere. Should we redefine
it later? That’s not very DRY of us.

Let’s change our dependency array to include our function reference. Your
`useEffect` should now look like this.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  getBookDetails();
}, [getBookDetails]);
```

And `getBookDetails` remains defined **above** the `useEffect`.

```js
const getBookDetails = async () => {
  const { data } = (await axios.get) < Book > `${BASE_URL}/${id}`;
  setBook(data);
};
```

Now we have a new `WARNING`:

```
WARNING in [eslint]
src/components/BookDetails.jsx
  Line 10:9:  The 'getBookDetails' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 18) change on every render. Move it inside the useEffect callback. Alternatively, wrap the definition of 'getBookDetails' in its own useCallback() Hook  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

webpack compiled with 1 warning
```

## Enter the `useCallback` Hook

In short, the `useCallback` hook allows you to cache, or ‘memoize,’ a function
between re-renders of your component. It performs a similar task to `useMemo`,
the nuances of which we will get into in a different article.

If the nitty-gritty of this interests you, you can read more about it in the
[React docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useCallback).

Please notice their warning:

- You should only rely on <code>useCallback</code> as a performance
  optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying
  problem and fix it first. Then you may add <code>useCallback</code> to improve
  performance. <br>

## `useCallback` Syntax

`useCallback` syntax is very similar to the `useEffect` syntax, which we already
know. Look at the skeletons of each.

```js
useEffect(() => {}, []);

useCallback(() => {}, []);
```

The slight difference is with `useEffect`, we tell the anonymous function to
execute our function while with `useCallback`, we assign the return value to a
reference to be called elsewhere.

First, we will import `useCallback` from `'react'`. Rather than adding a new
line, it’s best to destructure it along with our other imports.

```js
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
```

Now we can assign `getBookDetails` to the value returned from a `useCallback`
function call.

```js
const getBookDetails = useCallback();
```

Then we add all the syntax for `useCallback`. Remember your dependency array!

```js
const getBookDetails = useCallback(() => {}, []);
```

In our example, we need `async` before our parameters.

```js
const getBookDetails = useCallback(async () => {}, []);
```

And finally, we add the logic of our function into the code block.

```js
const getBookDetails = useCallback(async () => {
  const { data } = (await axios.get) < Book > `${BASE_URL}/${id}`;
  setBook(data);
}, []);
```

Once we save, we get… another `WARNING`.

```
WARNING in [eslint]
src/components/BookDetails.jsx
  Line 14:6:  React Hook useCallback has a missing dependency: 'id'. Either include it or remove the dependency array  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

webpack compiled with 1 warning
```

Let's think through this for a moment.

<details>
<summary>
Why should our dependency array track the <code>id</code> variable?
</summary>
<blockquote>
If the value of <code>id</code> changes, `getBookDetails` needs to hit a different endpoint, so React should redefine it. 
</blockquote>
</details>
</br>

After we add `id` to our dependency array, our finished `getBookDetails` and
`useEffect` functions should look like this. Look closely at the differences
between the way we implement the two hooks.

```js
const getBookDetails = useCallback(async () => {
  const { data } = (await axios.get) < Book > `${BASE_URL}/${id}`;
  setBook(data);
}, [id]);

useEffect(() => {
  getBookDetails();
}, [getBookDetails]);
```

And finally, that’s it! We see green in our React dev server. A happy linter is
a happy Senior Developer. And a happy Senior Developer is a happy you!
